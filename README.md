# CIDemo

This Repo was designed as a prototype to implement Continous Integration.This gives us the ability to automatically build and deploy our project based on whether certain tests have been passed or not. 
 
Initially we drew inspiration from the docs below which provide a guidline on using A CI system with a unity project.  

https://game.ci/docs/introduction/getting-started

We chose to work with Github Actions over Docker based solutions, due to it's integration with Github.

A current soluton allows us to run checks before building our unity project

## Our next steps
- Add WebGL deployment
- Add additional EditMode and PlayMode tests
- Expand the workflow to work with two branches "dev" and "main"
